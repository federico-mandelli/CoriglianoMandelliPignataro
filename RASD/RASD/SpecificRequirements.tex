\subsection{External interfaces requirements}
\subsubsection{User interfaces}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{R\arabic*}]
    \item The \ac{eMSP} must allow the users to register (providing email, password, payment method and his infos);
    \item The \ac{CPMS} must allow the \acp{CPO} to register (providing email, password, id-station, partita iva, number of possible charging slots);
    \item The system must allow the \acp{CPO} to modify the possible charging slots in their stations;
          % Maybe not useful anymore R4
    \item The system must verify the correctness of the identification data for the \acp{CPO};
    \item The system must allow the user to login;
    \item The system must allow the user to choose a specific station, a timeslot;
    \item The system must notify the user when the charging process is finished via a notification;
    \item The \ac{CPMS} must allow the \acp{CPO} to choose the mode (manual or automatic) of operation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Functional requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{R\arabic*}]
    \item The system must provide information () about the stations nearby;
    \item The system must reserve a position for a user who registered for a charge through the application;
    \item The system mustn't have collisions in the booking of charges; (non si possono registrare pi√π di X user per timeslot sovrapposti)
    \item The system must take the service money from the user payment method after the charging is finished;
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Sequence diagrams}
Below there are some sequence diagrams to show how the basic actions should be over time.
